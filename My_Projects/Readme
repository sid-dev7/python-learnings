## What is Git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time, tracks changes, and helps coordinate work among team members.

### Key Features of Git
- **Distributed Version Control:** Every user has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history.
- **Branching and Merging:** Easily create, switch, and merge branches to experiment and collaborate.
- **Data Integrity:** Every file and commit is checksummed, and retrieved by its checksum at any time.
- **Speed:** Git is optimized for performance and can handle large projects efficiently.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It provides a web-based graphical interface and access control, as well as collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis.

### Why Use GitHub?
- **Collaboration:** Work with others on projects from anywhere.
- **Backup:** Your code is safely stored in the cloud.
- **Open Source:** Share your work and contribute to others' projects.
- **Integration:** Connect with CI/CD tools, project management, and more.

## Basic Git Workflow
1. **Clone a repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
    creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.
   ```
2. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
3. **Add changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
4. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your message"
   ```
5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
6. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
